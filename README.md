# Object Recognition - Xiaohan Sun -s5321302

## Abstract

The input image is used to recognize the features in the image using the CNN architecture system and to classify the objects in the image.


## Detailed Description

Image data consisting of multiple channels is fed into a convolutional neural network, and after multiple convolution, pooling and activation, the data features are extracted. The output is then passed through a fully connected layer to complete the forward propagation process. The parameters are then updated in the back propagation by calculating the loss between the predicted value and the true value. This step is repeated until a model with better recognition results is trained.

### Datasets

Description of the datsets you will use, if creating your own, describe how you it will be collected.
